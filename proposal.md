# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO: Springing skies

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO: A vertical jumping game where players control a character, continously jumping between platforms to climb higher with increasing obstacles and challenges

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO: I am going to be making a vertical jumping-platform game called "Springing skies" similar to the famous mobile game Doodlejump. To play the game, the user will be able to control the character left and righht with both "A & D" or "left arrow & right arrow" keys respectively to move the jumping character from one platform to the next. As for features, there will be still platforms, moving platforms, and some obstsacles like a bird as user gets past a certain score. It will be excuted through pygame and python

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO: Background graphic display (like hurricane tracker) with sky image, score display

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Background graphic display (like hurricane tracker) with sky image,  score display, a jumping character for controls, platforms, character controls (A/D or left/right arrow key)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Background graphic display (like hurricane tracker) with sky image, a jumping character for controls, platofmrs, score display, character controls (A/D or left/right arrow key), high score save line on the graphics window, obstacles like moving bars or birds as player gets higher up 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO: I will defintlye have to learn pygame. Although pygame is related to python, I have neither learned pygame by mym own before nor do we learn it in this class. Therefore, I will use the resources Dr. Rosen provided with to learn and install pygame as well as youtoube videos for a detailed walkdown of how to best use pygame e.g i will need to do specific research on how to add a character, objects, etc. for my game
