# CIS-1051-Final-Project


The title of my project is "Springing Skies." IT is my Python-based time-pass or leisurely game for the final project which was achieved using Pygame and inspired by the popular mobile game "Doodle Jump." This game challenges players to guide the character of "Dr. ROSEN!" upwards through platforms to reach greater heights. Building this game involved overcoming various challenges including refining character movement, designing platforms at random locations, setting score statistics, and optimizing performance. It was an educational experience that enhanced my knowledge of game development, Pygame functionalities, and problem-solving. Despite the obstacles, I found the process enjoyable, because it really dif foster creativity and continuous learning. I created "Springing Skies" to provide an engaging and entertaining gaming experience during leisure time.
